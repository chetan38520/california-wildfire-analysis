Query1: What is the total area burned by wildfires each year?
The total area burned by wildfires changes each year, with the highest in 2015, 2021, and 2023.

Query2: Is there a correlation between the area burned and the financial loss, homes destroyed, businesses destroyed, etc.?
The correlation matrix shows a weak relationship between Area_Burned and financial loss, homes, and businesses destroyed. Estimated_Financial_Loss has a slight correlation with Fatalities. Vehicles_Damaged has a weak negative correlation with most variables. Other factors likely influence fire damage more than just the burned area.

Query3: What were the top 5 wildfires with the highest financial loss?

1 Butte County - 20.9%
2 Shasta County - 20.7%
3 Riverside County - 19.9%
4 Santa Barbara County - 19.3%

The red dashed trendline shows a decreasing wildfire occurrence pattern, and the blue dashed line represents the average number of wildfires, which seems to be around 10.

Query6: Is there a pattern or relationship between fatalities and the area burned?
Conclusion:
The number of fatalities does not strongly depend on the area burned.
Other factors (e.g., population density, evacuation measures, fire intensity) might influence fatalities more than just the area burned.

Query7: What is the yearly distribution of homes destroyed, businesses destroyed, vehicles damaged, and fatalities?
Conclusion:
a) 2014, 2018, and 2020 had the highest destruction of homes.
b) Businesses and vehicles follow a similar pattern with peaks in major wildfire years.
c) Fatalities remain relatively stable compared to property damage.

Query8: How do homes, businesses, and vehicles damaged correlate with the estimated financial loss?
Conclusion:
1. The destruction of homes, businesses, and vehicles does not strongly determine financial loss.
2. Other economic factors might play a larger role in estimating financial damage.
   
Query9: What is the trend in the number of injuries and fatalities over the years?
Conclusion:
a) Injuries exhibit a fluctuating pattern with multiple peaks, indicating wildfire severity differences each year.
b) Fatalities remain more stable, with a slight upward trend in recent years.
c) This trend suggests that while fire incidents are causing fluctuating injuries, fatalities are not increasing drastically.
